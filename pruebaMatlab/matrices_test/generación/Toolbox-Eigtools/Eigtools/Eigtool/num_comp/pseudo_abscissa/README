FILES:
This directory contains files and subdirectories for the 
criss cross algorithm to find eps-pseudospectral abscissa 
introduced in [1].  

	-chameig 	: Directory containing Mex files 
			(implemented by Emre Mengi) for 
		     	Peter Benner's fortran code to compute
		     	eigenvalues of a complex Hamiltonian matrix 
		   	Benner's source code is also included.
	-hameig		: Directory containing Mex files 
			(implemented by Peter Benner) for 
		     	Peter Benner's fortran code to compute 
                   	eigenvalues of a real Hamiltonian matrix
			Benner's source code is also included. 
	-pspa_2way.m 	: main m-file to compute eps-pseudospectral abscissa.
	-pspa_2way_imag.m : m-file used by pspa_2way.m (vertical search in [1]).
	-pspa_2way_real.m : m-file used by pspa_2way.m (horizontal search in [1]). 
	-isnaninf.m 	: m-file called by pspa_2way.m.


USAGE:
1- Directories chameig and hameig already contain the 
   compiled mex object files for Sun Solaris. If you
   need to recreate mex object files, please refer to
   README files under these directories. 
2- Add the directories chameig and hameig into your matlabpath
   by typing(assuming you are in this directory, pseudo_abscissa),

	addpath hameig
	addpath chameig

   Or otherwise make sure that the files under these directories
   are accessible from your current matlab directory.
3- Just call pspa_2way with correct parameters. Type 'help pspa_2way'
   to learn about the input and output parameters of this function.
