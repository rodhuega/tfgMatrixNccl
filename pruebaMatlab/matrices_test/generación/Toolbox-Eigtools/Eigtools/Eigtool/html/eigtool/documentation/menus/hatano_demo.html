Since the Nobel prize-winning work of P. Anderson in 1958, random
tridiagonal matrices have been famous as models of disordered
condensed matter quantum systems; their eigenvectors are
exponentially localized, and this is connected with lack of
transparency to light and conductivity to electrons of certain
1D physical systems [1].  The Hatano-Nelson model was proposed
in 1996 by two physicists as a contribution to the "nonhermitian
quantum mechanics" of certain systems in physics and biology [2].
This example matrix is tridiagonal and exponentially nonnormal;
pseudospectra such problems are analyzed in [3].  Hatano and
Nelson actually proposed the periodic analogue with nonzero
corner elements, which is much closer to normal.
