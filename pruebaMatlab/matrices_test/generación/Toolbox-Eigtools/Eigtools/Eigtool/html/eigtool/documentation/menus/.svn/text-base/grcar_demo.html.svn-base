<p>The Grcar matrix is also in the MATLAB gallery, and can be
created by the command 

<p><tt>G = gallery('grcar',N)</tt>

<p>This is a popular example in the field of matrix iterations
of a matrix whose spectrum is in the right half-plane but
whose numerical range is not.  It's also a popular example
in the study of nonsymmetric Toeplitz matrices.  The matrix
was first described in [1] and its pseudospectra were first
plotted in [2].
