If we truncate Expression \ref{Bernoulli10buena1}, then we obtain the following approximation:
$${P_m}(A) = \sum\limits_{i = 0}^m {{p_i^{(m)}}{A^i}},$$
where the coefficients ${p_i^{(m)}}$ depend on  
 the even integer $m$, fulfilling that these coefficients  approximate to the coefficients of the Taylor series when $m$ tends to $\infty$.
