\section{Conclusions}\label{section5}
In general, the implementation based on the new Bernoulli series (\ref{Bernoulli6})  is more accurate than (\ref{Bernoulli8}), 
comparing it with the one based on the Taylor series, algorithm  (\texttt{cosmtay}) and Hermite series, algorithm   (\texttt{cosmtayher}), 
and the one based in Pad\'e  rational approximation, algorithm (\texttt{cosm}).
